### Counting

"Sir Francis Bacon told a story, perhaps apocryphal, that illustrated just how empiricism was lost during the Middle Ages. The story was that a meeting of monks was taking place and the monks were hotly debating the issue of how many teeth were in the mouth of a horse. The problem was that they could not find the answer anywhere in Aristotle's work. Then, a young monk, perhaps at his first such meeting, timidly suggested that, because they had all come to the meeting on horseback, that one way to get the answer would be simply to go outside and count. Bacon went on to say that the young monk was expelled from the meeting!"
