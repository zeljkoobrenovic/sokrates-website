> "I drink a lot of coffee before I go to sleep so I can dream faster. I can dream like when they put [a camera on the Indy 500 … when they put a camera in the car](https://youtu.be/ATrmW5s2PiU), and it’s just whipping by like that. Dream after dream after dream after dream. People ask me the next day, “What did you dream about?” I say, “I don’t have time. I don’t have time to tell you this.”" — [Coffee and Cigarettes (2003)](https://youtu.be/pBa-2nXCc7g?t=68)
