In this book you will find many details about Sokrates and the way it processes source code. However, if you find this discussion too abstract, [Sokrates website](https://www.sokrates.dev/) provides a gallery with the results of analyses of 66 open-source projects in 24 programming languages. Each of the projects in the gallery both the all results of Sokrates analyses as well as a configuration file used to configure the analysis.
