            <i>When analyzing source code, you need to be strict in what you want to analyze and reject the rest. Otherwise, you will also end up publishing big, complex, and useless reports. The code that developers wrote manually is the most important. It contains critical content for understanding the system's unique structure, logic, and team's design decisions. While there are exceptions, another code and files are usually irrelevant for understanding the system's unique aspects. Sokrates performs the scoping in two steps. First, it conducts a broad relevance scoping, based on the source code file extensions and a set of configurable ignore patterns. Then it zooms in the filtered files and classifies it into main ones and secondary ones.</i>

    <li>Logical decomposition is a representation of, or a view on the organization of the main source code. In such a view every and each file is put in exactly one logical component.</li>
    <li>A Sokrates enables defining multiple logical decompositions for each system.</li>
    <li>In Sokrates, a logical decomposition is considered invalid if a file is selected into two or more components.This constraint is introduced in order to facilitate measuring of dependencies among components.</li>
    <li>Files not assigned to any component are put into a special “Unclassified” component.</li>
    <li>A logical decomposition can be defined in three ways in Sokrates.</li>
    <li>First approach is based on the folders structure. Components are mapped to folders at defined folder depth relative to the source code root folder.</li>
    <li>Second approach is based on explicit definition of each component. In such explicit definitions, components are explicitly named and their files are selected based on explicitly defined path and content filters.</li>
    <li>Third approach is based on dynamic definition of components and their names. In such dynamic definitions, components are not explicitly named, but the name is derived based on script with string transformations of file path or content.</li>
